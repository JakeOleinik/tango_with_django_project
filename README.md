# Rango website

This is a Django-powered website that was born as a result of completion of the excellent ["Tango with Django"](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/) book.
The website is available live [here](http://jakie.pythonanywhere.com/rango/).
I highly recommend the book, as it gave me a solid start in web development, and led me to launching my own [web-service](http://handlr.me).

Shall you want to run the site on your machine, simply do
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the required packages, and then run
```
python manage.py runserver
```
to run it on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Enjoy!
